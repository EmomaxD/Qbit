1.Descriptive Names: Use descriptive names that convey the purpose or functionality of the element. This applies to variables, functions, classes, and other entities within your codebase.

2.CamelCase: Follow the CamelCase convention for naming classes, structs, and functions. Start with a lowercase letter for variables and functions, and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word.

3.PascalCase: Use PascalCase for naming namespaces and enum types. Capitalize the first letter of each word, including the first word.

4.All Uppercase: For constants and preprocessor macros, use all uppercase letters with underscores (_) separating words. This convention helps distinguish constants from regular variables.

5.Avoid Single-letter Names: Except for loop counters or very short-lived variables, avoid using single-letter names. They often lack meaning and can lead to confusion.

6.Meaningful Prefixes or Suffixes: Incorporate meaningful prefixes or suffixes to indicate the type or purpose of variables or functions. For example, "m_" for member variables, "s_" for static variables, "get" or "set" prefixes for getter and setter functions.

7.Consistency: Maintain consistency throughout your codebase. Use similar naming conventions for similar entities. This makes your code easier to understand and navigate.

8.Avoid Abbreviations: While shortening names can save keystrokes, it often sacrifices readability. Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood within the context of your project or industry.

9.Avoid Reserved Keywords: Ensure your names don't conflict with C++ keywords or OpenGL reserved identifiers.

10.Namespace Qualification: Use namespaces to organize your code logically and prevent naming conflicts. Prefix your classes and functions with the appropriate namespace to avoid naming clashes.

11.Clear Function Names: Function names should clearly indicate their purpose and behavior. Use verbs to describe actions performed by functions, making it easier for other developers to understand their intent.

12.Avoid Hungarian Notation: Avoid using Hungarian notation, where the name of a variable includes a prefix that denotes its type. Modern IDEs provide features like syntax highlighting and tooltips that make this practice unnecessary.
